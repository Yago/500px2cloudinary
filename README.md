## Usage

First of all, you need to have the following tools installed globally on your environment:
- [📗 NodeJS 8+](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime used to build the project
- [🐈 Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) - Dependency manager built on top of the NPM registry


Then, you need to setup the project after cloning (or downloading) :

```bash
$ cd path/to/project
$ yarn
$ cp config.sample.json config.json
$ vim config.json
```

Finally, simply hit the **`$ yarn start`** and *enjoy 😎
